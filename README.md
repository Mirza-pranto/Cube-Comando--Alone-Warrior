### üé® Visual Experience
*   **Dynamic 3D Environment:** Rendered with OpenGL for smooth, immersive graphics.
*   **Pulsing Visual Effects:** Enemies pulse and change color based on their health status.
*   **Sphere Markers:** Strategic indicators show spawn and exit points with colorful blink effects.
*   **Pickup Notifications:** Clear visual feedback when collecting power-ups.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Game Mechanics
*   **Smart Enemy AI:** Enemies move strategically toward your position and the exit.
*   **Precision Shooting:** Physics-based bullet collision system with knockback effects.
*   **Cheat Mode:** Secret mode (`C` key) with auto-aim and rapid fire for when things get tough!
*   **Camera Control:** Free camera movement or follow player with toggleable perspectives.

### üìä Progression System
*   **Score Tracking:** Comprehensive scoring system with bonuses for different enemy types.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

### Controls
| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `W` `A` `S` `D` | Move and rotate your warrior |
| `Mouse Left` | Fire your weapon |

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate

System Requirements
Python 3.6+

PyGame 2.5.2+

NumPy (for OpenGL operations)

OpenGL-compatible graphics card

üéÆ Gameplay Tips
Position Strategically: Don't get surrounded - use the entire bridge space.

Prioritize Targets: Focus on enemies closest to the exit first.

Conserve Ammo: Aim carefully to avoid reaching the missed shot limit.

Collect Power-ups: Always grab health and ammo when available.

Use Cheat Mode Wisely: When enabled, cheat mode automatically aims and fires at enemies.

üöÄ Why This Project Stands Out
Pure Python Power: Demonstrates complex 3D game development using only Python and OpenGL

Performance Optimized: Smooth gameplay despite being in an interpreted language

Complete Game Experience: From menus to game over screens with full restart functionality

Modern Game Features: Includes health bars, visual effects, and progressive difficulty

Great Learning Resource: Excellent codebase for understanding 3D graphics and game physics
